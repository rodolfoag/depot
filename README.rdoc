== RoR::Pragmatic Bookshelf Online Store

This project is the implementation of the Pragmatic Bookshelf, an online store implemented trough the reading of the book Agile Web Development with Rails (http://pragprog.com/book/rails32/agile-web-development-with-rails-3-2). Developing this project during the reading is a great way to understand how the rails ecosystem works, its conventions and how you can find your way around it.
